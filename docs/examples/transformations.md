# Transformations

With transformations we can manipulate data prior to writing to the data store.

## Aggregate

With aggregates we can take multiple records and output a single record.

## Pivot

With pivots you can turn one record into many.

## Project

With project you can translate your current type into a new type.

## Transform

With transform you can apply changes in-place.
